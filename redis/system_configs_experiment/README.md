# Experiment Details

This experiment focuses on seeing how performance and aggregate throughput of multiple redis-server instances
scales as you run various number of redis instances alongside each other, and what performance looks like in different system configurations.


*Note: All of the data has been normalized to the first iteration of the __controls_off__ case.
